        <intro n="1">The following letter was introduced in <name>Wilde's</name> libel trial by
                <name>sir Edward Clark,</name>
            <name>Wilde's</name> attorney. Although the letter lends support to the defense case,
                <name>Clark</name> chose to introduce the letter to prevent the defense from
            introducing the letter in a more dramatic fashion during its case.</intro>

        <beginning>My Own Boy,</beginning>
        <body n="1">Your <literature>sonnet</literature> is quite lovely, and it is a marvel that
            those <color>red-roseleaf</color>
            <bodypart>lips</bodypart> of yours should be made no less for the madness of music and
            song than for the madness of kissing. Your slim gilt soul walks between passion and
                <literature>poetry</literature>. I know <name>Hyacinthus</name>, whom
                <name>Apollo</name> loved so madly, was you in Greek days. Why are you alone in
                <place>London</place>, and when do you go to <place>Salisbury</place>? Do go there
            to cool your <bodypart>hands</bodypart> in the <color>grey</color> twilight of Gothic
            things, and come here whenever you like. It is a lovely place and lacks only you; but go
            to <place>Salisbury</place> first.</body>
        <ending n="1">Always, with undying love, Yours,</ending>
